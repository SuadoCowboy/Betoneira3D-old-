(engine)
- - file.h/.cpp
- (those are supposed to be inside FileHandler class)
- binary file handler(do we need to create a class related to memory?)
- image loader(probably related to binary file handler)
- audio loader(probably related to binary file handler... should a binary handler class be created?)
- 3d model loader

- (those are supposed to have their own classes)
- ini file handler class(something like IniHandler? ConfigFileHandler?)
